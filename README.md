# Refactored Branch using Redux

  - This branch uses Redux
  - This branch is the App converted to use **Redux**
  - This branch combines UI state with **Redux**
  - To check the same project that does not use **Redux** you can compare this branch to the **No Redux** branch
  - If you only want to see the Original App without **Redux** switch to the **No Redux** branch


**Redux branch**:
  - Makes use of **Redux**, and Local UI state
  - Uses **Redux store, Reducers, Dispatchers** to create a flow of state throughout the app
